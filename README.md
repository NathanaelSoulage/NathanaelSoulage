On this GitHub account, I am sharing with you some of my projects. You can find them, presented in a nicer way, on my online portfolio

I hold a Bachelor's and Master's degree, in Economics, from Sciences Po Paris. I am a former RA for Prof. Isabelle Méjean (Sciences Po), and a data replicator for the Journal of Political Economy.
